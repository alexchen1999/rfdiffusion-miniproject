# rfdiffusion-miniproject
This is a mini project that adapts the RFDiffusion tutorial to generate backbone structures to a known antibody, getting the sequence from the structure using ProteinMPNN, validating the sequence with AF2, and conducts side-chain packing of the structure using PyRosetta.

Please see the colab nb diffusion.ipynb in the top-level directory for the code adaptation.
